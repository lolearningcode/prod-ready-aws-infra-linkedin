# ðŸš€ Prod-Ready AWS Infrastructure with Terraform

This project provisions a **production-ready AWS environment** using Terraform.  
Itâ€™s designed to be simple enough for learning, but structured the way real teams deploy to production.  

âœ… VPC with public + private subnets  
âœ… ECS Fargate cluster with sample app (nginx)  
âœ… Application Load Balancer (ALB) with HTTPS  
âœ… IAM GitHub OIDC role (no static AWS creds)  
âœ… Remote state in S3 with DynamoDB locking  
âœ… CloudWatch logging, metrics, and alarms  
âœ… Optional SNS email alerts for incidents
